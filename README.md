# RL Lightning
A Research-Oriented RL Framework Using Pytorch-Lightning

# Basic idea
Using pytorch + lightning for an easy to use RL framework.

## Algorithm should include:
- DQN
- Multi-step DQN
- Prioritized DQN
- Double DQN
- Dueling DQN
- Rainbow?
- TD3
- SAC
- DDPG
- PPO
- A2C?
- EMDQN?


## Functionals should include:

- auto logging and plotting
  - yesÔºÅ
- easy hyper-parameter saving and loading
- hyper parameter tuning
  - use Optuna
- expandability
  - Well inherited and disentangled code 
  - No boilerplate code 


## What should each part do?

### agent
- should define how to interact with env (given a state and exploration, return an action)
- should define the learning loss


### learner
- should define the optimizer
- should define the training step, control how each part is used, e.g. exploration schedule, how long to interact with env and how long to train

### buffer/data module
- should define how to restore(off policy)/generate(on policy) and sample data

### env
- should define the MDP agent is in
